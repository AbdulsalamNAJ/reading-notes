Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format.

Markdown is two things: 1. a plain text formatting syntax; and 2. a software tool, written in Perl, that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. See the Syntax page for details pertaining to Markdown’s formatting syntax.

### It Converts to HTML Easily

Now, if you’re going to be writing HTML, you should just…write HTML. But if you’re, say, writing an email or a readme file where you need HTML’s formatting options but not the full breadth of its features, Markdown is perfect.

In fact, Markdown has the software to convert the plain text to HTML built in, So Markdown is actually a text-to-HTML conversion software in addition to being a markup language.

Plus, if you tried to convert from a *.docx* file to HTML You often get so much extra formatting and spacing that it’s not worth the effort.

## GitHub Pages
