HTML is an abbreviation of the sentence *“Hyper Text Markup Language”*  and it is used to tell the browser what content to show inside it like a text, table, images and videos.

But before we make the HTML webpage it’s preferably to make a sketch about how it should be appeared to make it easier to predict and to show it to other people and take their opinions.

## One of the useful tools is Wireframe, so what is Wireframe?

A wireframe is a basic visual representation of a web page, app interface, or product layout. Product designers and UX professionals draw up wireframes to communicate how they plan to arrange.

## What Are the Benefits of Wireframes?

1. Allows the team to communicate about which functionality and content to prioritize in the product or site.

2. Document and communicate how various aspects of the app or website will connect.

3. Establish consistent ways of displaying particular content across the site.

5. Clarify for stakeholders across the company the product team’s plans for the product and the user experience.

## So how HTML works?

HTML consists of a series of short codes typed into a text-file by the site author  these are the tags. The text is then saved as html file, and viewed through a browser, like Internet Explorer or chrome. This browser reads the file and translates the text into a visible form, hopefully rendering the page as the author had intended. Writing your own HTML entails using tags correctly to create your vision. 

## What are the HTML tags?

The tags are what separate normal text from HTML code. You might know them as the words between the `<angle-brackets>`. They allow all the cool stuff like images and tables and stuff, just by telling your browser what to render on the page, so different tags will perform different functions.

When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right. HTML tags are used to create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different properties.

An HTML file must have some essential tags so that web browser can differentiate between a simple text and HTML text. You can use as many tags you want as per your code requirement.

HTML code is made up of elements. Many elements (but not all) are made up of opening and closing tags.

### Heading Tags

Any document starts with a heading. You can use different sizes for your headings. HTML also has six levels of headings, which use the elements `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, and <h6>`. While displaying any heading, browser adds one line before and one line after that heading.

### Paragraph Tag

The <p> tag offers a way to structure your text into different paragraphs. Each paragraph of text should go in between an opening <p> and a closing </p> tag as shown below in the example: `<p> Any Text here </p>`

### Horizontal Lines

Horizontal lines are used to visually break-up sections of a document. The `<hr>` tag creates a line from the current position in the document to the right margin and breaks the line.

### Image Tag

The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
